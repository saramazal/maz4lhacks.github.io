# 🕵️‍♂️ Port Forwarding with Windows: Netsh

In internal network engagements, gaining access to a user workstation—like a Windows-based IT admin's machine—can be an excellent pivot point for further exploration. One powerful built-in tool that enables this is `netsh.exe`.

This post covers how to use `netsh` to **forward ports** from a compromised Windows host to an internal target, enabling you to connect to internal services like RDP via the pivot.

---

## 🔧 Scenario Setup

We’ve compromised an IT admin's **Windows 10** workstation using phishing or social engineering. The machine has two IPs:

* **External IP (reachable by attacker)**: `10.129.xx.xx`
* **Internal IP (inside network)**: `172.16.xx.xx`

### 🖥️ Host Overview

| Role               | Variable                    | Example Value       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Attacker Host      | `$ATTACKER_HOST`            | Your Kali box       |
| Pivot Host (Win)   | `$PIVOT_WIN_HOST`           | 10.129.xx.xx.       |
| Target Host (Win)  | `$TARGET_WIN_HOST`          | 172.16.xx.xx         |
| Pivot Credentials  | `$PIVOT_USER:$PIVOT_PASS`   | e.g. admin\:pass123 |
| Target Credentials | `$TARGET_USER:$TARGET_PASS` | e.g. user\:pass456  |

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Port Forwarding with Netsh

### 1. RDP into the Pivot Host

From your attacker machine:

```bash
xfreerdp /u:$PIVOT_USER /p:$PIVOT_PASS /v:$PIVOT_WIN_HOST
```

---

### 2. Set Up Port Forwarding on the Pivot

Run the following command on the pivot host to forward traffic from external port `8080` to internal RDP port `3389` on the target:

```cmd
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=8080 listenaddress=$PIVOT_WIN_HOST connectport=3389 connectaddress=$TARGET_WIN_HOST
```

🔧 This makes the pivot listen on `10.129.xx.xx:8080` and forward it to `172.16.xx.xx:3389`.

---

### 3. Verify the Port Proxy Rule

Run:

```cmd
netsh interface portproxy show v4tov4
```

You should see:

```
Listen on ipv4:             Connect to ipv4:
Address         Port        Address         Port
--------------- ----------  --------------- ----------
10.129.xx.xx   8080        172.16.xx.xx     3389
```

---

### 4. RDP to the Internal Target via the Forward

From your **attacker machine**, use the following command to connect to the internal target through the pivot:

```bash
xfreerdp /u:$TARGET_USER /p:$TARGET_PASS /v:$PIVOT_WIN_HOST:8080
```

🔄 Netsh on the pivot host will forward this traffic to the internal host’s RDP port.

## 🧽 Cleanup

After the operation, remove the rule:

```cmd
netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenport=8080 listenaddress=$PIVOT_WIN_HOST
```

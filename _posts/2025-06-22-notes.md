### ðŸ§  Note-Taking Tools Review: Notion vs. Obsidian

When it comes to organizing thoughts, research, or OSINT logs, **Notion** and **Obsidian** stand out.

ðŸ”— **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)**
A powerful all-in-one workspace. Great for structured notes, task management, and collaboration. Ideal for bug bounty hunters who need to document workflows and share with teammates.

âœ… Cloud-based

âœ… Team-friendly

âœ… Databases, templates, and embeds

ðŸ”— **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**
Perfect for offline, markdown-based knowledge management. It shines for those who love linking ideas like a personal wiki. Excellent for deep research and CTF note archiving.

âœ… Local-first & private

âœ… Markdown support

âœ… Graph view for connected notes

ðŸŽ¯ **My take:**

* Use **Notion** for productivity and collaboration.
* Use **Obsidian** for personal knowledge bases, cheat sheets, and learning notes.

Which one are you using in your workflow?
